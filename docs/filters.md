# Filters

This module is used to apply conditions to players, blocks, and events. This is used in conjunction with regions to determine exactly what should happen to certain things in the match, by declaring `DENY`, `ALLOW`, or `ABSTAIN`. Filters are the most useful feature to customize your maps and make them unique.

## Example

Prevent explosions from destroying the `blue-spawn` region.

```json
	"filters": [
		{
			"type": "block-explode", "evaluate": "deny", "teams": ["blue", "red"],
			"regions": ["blue-spawn"], "message": "&cYou are not allowed to modify terrain here."
		}
        ],
	"regions": [
		{ "id": "blue-spawn", "type": "cuboid", "min": "121, 16, -33", "max": "123, 12, -35" }
	]
```

### Filter Attributes

| Attribute | Description                                                           | Value  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `type`    | The **type** of filter used to apply a condition.                     | String |
| `evaluate`| How the condition applies to the team (`DENY`, `ALLOW`, `ABSTAIN`)    | String |
| `teams`   | The teams that the filter applies to.                                 | Team   |
| `message` | The message that should be sent to players when the filter activates. | String |
| `regions` | The regions that the filter is meant to modify.                       | Region |

The types of filters allowed to be used are filters that are coded into TGM: Therefore, you cannot modify events that are not already supported. The types of filters are listed below, used in conjunction with `type`.
