# Teams

This module is used to specify the teams used in the match and what their attributes are. Matches without teams can be setup by configuring one team, using the `ffa` module, and defining multiple spawns.

## Example

```json
    "teams": [
        {"id": "players", "name": "Players", "color": "dark_aqua", "min": 1, "max": 40}
    ],
```

### Team Attributes

| Attribute | Description                                                           | Value  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `id`      | The identifier used to reference teams from other places in the JSON. | String |
| `name`    | The name of the team.                                                 | String |
| `color`   | The color of the team.                                                | String |
| `min`     | The minimum amount of players required to start.                      | Number |
| `max`     | The maximum amount of players allowed to join.                        | Number |

**NOTE:** Spectator teams are generated by the plugin, and therefore are not created via the JSON.
